                            <p style="text-align: center;"><u><b>I'm Nick Jacobs, a full stack software developer from Milwaukee, WI.</b></u> </p> 
                            
                            <p>I have traveled down many paths in life before deciding this one.</p>

                            <p>
                               I started working in the service industry, and that occupied 15 years of my work life.  
                            I went to university to become a teacher, and switched my focus to political science.  
                            Eventually I had the realization that it was not for me.  
                            </p> 
                            
                            <p>I continued working in the service industry for a few years, but my passion was always with tech.  
                                Ever since I was a child, I was fascinated with computers and technology.
                                I ran an online gaming community, going as far as building a LLC, renting servers and maintaining a forum site.  
                                I severly missed it as I grew older.  Eventually the pandemic hit
                                and I decided to take a risk, leave my job and attend a coding bootcamp.  </p>
                            
                            The amount of raw information was intimidating at first.  
                            But as I battle onward, it only solidifies my desire and passion for working in the industry.  
                            No day is mundane when accepting new challenges.</p>
